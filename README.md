# tts_workflow

The goal is project is to build on top of using Piperâ€˜s text to speech. I have it usable in a command line, but I would prefer to create a user interface in order to create different people, talking at different times, and overall organized things in a more coherent way. Currently it only works with a string, but utilizing this out mostly be able to break it up into smaller chunks and then re-apply it as string
